# TheBigShort
This is our github for our Fall 2023 Data Dive project where we take a look at historical rates of different banks and compare them to the National rates to try and predict future collapses based on the 2008 Recession.


Our NewInterestRateData file contains columns for federal fund rates like the APR, FFR, and SPX(though in the sense that much of the financial world revolves around the S&P 500). We also have yearly stock averages for 8 banks to have a baseline. To best predict future collapses, two factors we chose were the Interest on Deposit and Loan on Default for each company. These two factors for each bank were what we thought would be the best way to help predict future collapses.
